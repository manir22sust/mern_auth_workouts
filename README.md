# MERN Auth Workouts

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. The application provides a basic authentication system that allows users to signup, login, and logout. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to a dashboard page.

### Features

- User registration with email and password
- User login with email and password
- User logout
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication
- Dashboard page after successful authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/manir22sust/mern_auth_workouts.git

2. Install the dependencies using the following command:
   npm install

3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following configuration:
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>

Replace <your_mongodb_uri> with your MongoDB connection string and <your_jwt_secret_key> with your preferred secret key.

4. Run the application using the following command:

yarn dev or npm run dev

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

### Conclusion

This MERN stack application with JWT authentication provides a basic authentication system that can be used as a starting point for more complex applications. The application uses modern technologies and best practices to ensure security and scalability.
